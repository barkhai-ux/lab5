# Skills Demonstrated

## Web Development

- **Single-Page Application Architecture** - Built a fully functional code editor as a self-contained single HTML file
- **DOM Manipulation** - Extensive use of vanilla JavaScript for dynamic UI rendering without frameworks
- **Event Handling** - Keyboard shortcuts, click events, drag-and-drop, input listeners, and scroll synchronization
- **CSS Custom Properties** - Theme system using CSS variables with multiple theme definitions (Mocha, Latte, Dracula, Nord)
- **Responsive Layout** - Flexbox-based layout with resizable panels via drag interaction

## JavaScript

- **Syntax Highlighting Engine** - Custom tokenizer/highlighter for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without external libraries
- **Emmet Abbreviation Expansion** - Tab-triggered expansion of shorthand into full HTML/CSS markup
- **Auto-close Logic** - Bracket, quote, and tag auto-closing with smart cursor placement
- **Tree Data Structure** - Recursive file/folder tree with parent-child relationships and nested rendering
- **Drag and Drop** - Native HTML5 drag-and-drop API for reordering files between folders
- **Clipboard Operations** - Copy, cut, and paste for files/folders within the file tree
- **ZIP Generation** - Client-side ZIP archive creation using JSZip with folder structure preservation
